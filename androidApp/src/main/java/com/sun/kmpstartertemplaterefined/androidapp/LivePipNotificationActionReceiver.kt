/**
 * Receives broadcasts triggered by the "mute/unmute" and "stop playback" buttons on the PiP notification.
 *
 * Must be registered in AndroidManifest.xml (exported=false because it is only used by its own
 * PendingIntent and should not be triggered by other apps).
 *
 * The design intentionally uses "broadcast" rather than "directly calling a method on an object"
 * because when the user clicks on a notification's PendingIntent, the system will deliver the
 * corresponding Intent directly to this Receiver—even if the app currently has no Activity running
 * (for example, the user has swiped away the app, leaving only this notification). This is exactly
 * the purpose of PendingIntent.getBroadcast: to decouple from the Activity lifecycle and have the
 * system guarantee delivery.
